# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Error with Missing Field

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines when dealing with documents that may be missing a field used in the pipeline. The error occurs when trying to group documents by a field (`metadata.version` in this case) that does not exist in all documents. 

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains a MongoDB aggregation pipeline that attempts to group documents by the `metadata.version` field. If some documents in the collection lack this field, the aggregation pipeline throws an error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a solution to this problem by using the `$exists` operator within the `$match` stage to filter out documents that are missing the `metadata.version` field before the grouping operation. This prevents the error and allows the aggregation to proceed successfully.  The solution ensures that only documents with the necessary field are processed in the grouping stage.
